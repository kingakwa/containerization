DOCKER
======
Docker -- Is a containerization multi-platform software use to create, build
 ship, share and deploy applications as containers
 Build applications 
 ship applications 
 deploy applications
IQ: How many environmentS are you supporting in your CURRENT role??
 Development environment 
 Testing/QA/Stage environment 
 Production environment
Containers --> contains are everything required for an application to run 
 (App Files (code), Dependencies 
 (Softwares +Libraries), ENV vars & Other Configuration files) 
 which is required for a piece of application/process to run.
 app.war -----> Virtual Machine 
 java and Tomcat installed and configured
 
Containerise the following applications 
 app code = app.war + 
 Dependencies = tomcat9 + openjdk11+
 app code = app.ear + 
 dependencies = openjdk11+ + jboss/wildFly 
 app code = app.jar + 
 dependencies = java1.8+ 
 
vertualisation deployments most of the times faces environmental issues/differences
 dev --- application working well in dev
 test --- application working well in test
 prod --- application failing in pod
Containerization Software/Runtime include --> :
 Docker, = over 80% usage 
 Rocket, 
 Pod man, 
 CRI-O, 
 Core-OS,
 Container-D.
